### README

Welcome to the frontend of our project!

This frontend application leverages the following technologies:

- **React**: A powerful library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture helps create interactive UIs efficiently.
- **Redux**: Used for state management, Redux helps in maintaining a predictable state across the application and managing complex state interactions.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Provides a utility-first approach to styling, making it easy to create responsive and customizable designs without leaving the HTML.
- **Vite**: A modern build tool that provides fast development and optimized production builds for a smoother development experience.
